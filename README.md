1) Open Sudoku.xlsm and write the sudoku you want to solve

2) Open Sudoku.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook and execute the code
	a) Firstly it uses backtracking method

	b) Secondly it uses MCMC Metropolis hastings method

3) Note that it works way better the backtracking method. Difficult sudoku are not resolvable by MCMC
